# coli-whole-cell-coarse-grained-model

Code for paper in preparation.

The folder `model-code` contains all the model analytics and simulation functions, mostly in `matlab`, except the simulation code for the stochastic model that is written in `c++`.
For the `c++` code, the source is given, but the binary has been compiled on a make with `qmake`.


The folder `experimental-data` contains data from the following studies: `Scott et al., 2010`, `Basan et al., 2015` and `Si et al., 2017`.
